# -Password-Generator
Overview

This is a simple password generator application that allows users to generate strong passwords based on selected criteria. The project is designed to help users understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM, handles user input, and generates random characters dynamically.

Features

Password Length Selection: Users can adjust the password length using a slider (6 to 20 characters).

Character Type Selection: Users can choose to include capital letters, small letters, numbers, and special characters.

Dynamic Updates: The selected password length updates in real-time.

Instant Password Generation: Clicking the 'Generate Password' button creates a secure password.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the webpage.

CSS: Styling for the interface.

JavaScript: Handles user interactions and password generation.

How It Works

The user selects the desired password length using a slider.

The user can choose from four options:

Capital Letters

Small Letters

Numbers

Special Characters

Clicking the 'Generate Password' button generates a password based on the selected criteria.

The password is displayed on the screen in real-time.

Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Password-Generator.git

Open the index.html file in a browser.

Select password preferences and click 'Generate Password' to create a new password.

Learning Purpose

This project is useful for understanding:

JavaScript Event Handling: Working with button clicks and input changes.

Random Character Generation: How to generate secure passwords.

DOM Manipulation: Updating UI dynamically based on user input.

Using Sliders and Checkboxes: Handling user-selected options.

Future Enhancements

Copy to Clipboard Feature: Add a button to copy the generated password.

Password Strength Indicator: Show a strength meter based on character selection.

Theming: Dark mode and better UI improvements.

Set Password Length: Adjust the slider to define password length.

Select Character Types: Choose from uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Generate Password: Click the Generate Password button to create a random password.

Display Password: The generated password appears in the heading.

Code Highlights

Event Listeners:

Slider Input Event: Updates the displayed password length dynamically.

slider.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
    rangeVal.innerText = e.target.value;
});

Password Generation Logic:

Random Selection of Characters:

for (let i = 0; i < slider.value; i++) {
    let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * finalStr.length);
    generatedPassword += finalStr.charAt(randomNumber);
}

Preventing Empty Selection:

Ensures at least one option is chosen before generating a password.

if (finalStr === '') {
    alert('Please Choose One Option');
}

Learning Purpose

This project helps learners understand:

Event Handling in JavaScript.

Manipulating the DOM dynamically.

Using JavaScript Math Functions for randomization.

Conditionally constructing strings based on user preferences.

Future Enhancements

Copy to Clipboard button.

Password Strength Indicator.

Improved UI with CSS animations.
